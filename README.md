# TriStake
Total Stake Counter application that allows users to track the total stake for three different blockchain networks: Cardano, Polkadot, and Kusama.

## Introduction
Welcome to TriStake Monitor, an innovative web app that will show you what's going on with staking on various blockchain networks in real-time. 
This literature will explain the project's technology stack, how to build and run it locally, the project's most important features, 
and where to find more information.

## Tools and Technology

ReactStake Monitor uses cutting-edge technology to make a strong analysis tool for staking:

 - **ReactJS**: The front end of the project is made with ReactJS, which is a famous JavaScript library for making user interfaces. React makes sure that users have a lively and easy-to-use experience.

 - **SubScan API**: We use the SubScan API to get real-time staking data from blockchain networks like Polkadot and Kusama, which gives us correct and up-to-date information.

 - **Ant Design**: Ant Design is a flexible design system and component library that is used to make user interface parts that look good and work well.

## How to Build Locally

 - Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/Priyanshu-Singh-1/TriStake
```

 - Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd TriStake-Counter
```

 - Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

 - Get the API key from [here](https://pro.subscan.io/api_service). Put this API key in the src << features\api << apiSlice.js
 - Start the Development Server
```
npm start
```

 - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access TriStake Counter.

#### Note:
It was a very fun and challenging task. This was the first time where I had learned so many things and developed a product within a day. Though I have worked with some limitations, but this was best learning part with this task. Also, this was the first time for me to learn about the chains that works on Proof of Stake. This is also a very beautiful concept, and this was a very much awesome journey.
